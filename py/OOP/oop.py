Challenge
Use the planning strategy and process demonstrated above to design a parking lot. This is a common OOP interview question and the time you spend thoughtfully thinking through this problem will be helpful.

As you design your solution, and think through all of the necessary objects, attributes, methods, and relationships, keep the following in mind:

Payments
What methods are allowed?
Where do customers pay?
Capacity
How does the system respond when the lot is full?
How does the system know when the lot is full?
Vehicles
Is capacity allocated differently depending on what type of vehicle enters the lot? How so?
Pricing
Are there different rates for different times of day? How will this be handled?
Is there a discount for purchasing a longer total time?
